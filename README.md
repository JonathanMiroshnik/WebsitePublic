# WebsitePublic
Public facing repository of my personal website, [sensorcensor.xyz](https://www.sensorcensor.xyz)

**To start up the website for yourself**, please run "npm install" on the server, client and main folders.
After that, to start up the Node server, please run "npm start" command in the server folder.
To run the React server, please run the "npm start" command in the client folder.

As of **29.1.25**, Please add a file named ".env" to the server folder with the following format:
API_KEY_CHATGPT=""
API_KEY_DEEPSEEK=""
PORT=5000

And add the API keys accordingly, as you see fit. The Node server runs on port 5000 while the React server runs on the default port 3000.
